# So, you wanna help us!
Thanks a lot! Here's some basic advice:
- Even if you're a contributor, please make a branch/fork and open a PR for most stuff. Minor grammar fixes and the like can be commited directly to master.
- If you can, test your edits. If you din't have the ability, let us know and we'll test it for you.
- PLEASE don't change the structure of files without our permission, or rename them without making sure all other files that rely on the file(s) in question have been updated. Only rename if you feel it's a good idea.
- Preferably use British English in the files themselves; for issues and PRs, feel free to use any kind of English.

With that out of the way, thanks! :D
